# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:
    
    Git is the most popular version control tool, currently. It allows multiple people to work on the same code, checkout different versions of the code, and rollback code to previously submitted codebase. Code can be worked on by numerous people in an orginization or strangers online at the same time locally on their own computers then submitted and potentially combined using built in merging processes.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:

    Currently with JavaScript ES6 the operators that return a boolean value are the less-than, less-than-or-equal-to, greater-than, greater-than-or-equal-to, strict-equal, and loose-equal operators. A not operator will also provide you with a boolean value true when combined with any falsey object/value or false if combined with any truthy value.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:

    Index is used when referencing array like objects or strings, which indicates a key to the value of the item in the list based on an incrementing number, starting at zero for the first item/value and incrementing by one for each item in the array/string. The index is usually indicated by enclosing a number in square brackets to the right of the string or array. 
    The difference between index and value is that the index is the pointer indicating the address of the data stored and the value is the data to be used/displayed or modified.

4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:

    Iteration is the process of moving through multiple pieces of data systematically and executing the same steps for each item exactly like the last item, until all items have been processed/iterated over. This process is used in programming via loops and built in looping methods, such as: for loops, while loops, forEach method, .map method, and reduce method to name a few.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

    Pair programming techniques are guidelines used to give structure to people who work on the same project to ensure code consistency, reduce code replecation, and project progression. Working with fellow developers at Learn Academy, we practice a driver/navigator pair programming technique. Driver/Navigator programming ensures programmers have a person working on the input of the code aka, the driver and the second pair programmer directing the drivers coding thinking about the larger picture, logic and research.
    The driver's primary of concern is the input of the code, ensuring the programming language syntax is correct. The driver can and is encouraged to comment or discuss any potential errors, possible code duplication, or more effective ways to complete a task that the navigator may suggest. 
    The navigator's responsibility is to think about the logic and process that will be required to complete the task at hand. This includes looking up concepts that may need to be learned to complete the task, breaking down the problem into individual tasks/processes.
    The driver and navigator combined are responsible for the entirety of the code submitted as well as switching positions to ensure experience is shared amongst partners.
