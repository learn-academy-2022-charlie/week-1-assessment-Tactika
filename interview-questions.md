# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:
    
    Git is the most popular version control tool, currently. It allows multiple people to work on the same code, checkout different versions of the code, and rollback code to previously submitted codebase. Code can be worked on by numerous people in an orginization or strangers online at the same time locally on their own computers then submitted and potentially combined using built in merging processes.
    

  Researched answer:

    Git is a source code management version control software created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, which is now known for its branching techniques. The branching technique allows for programmers to collaborate on source code of their software using thousands of possible versions of code path implementation. 



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:

    Currently with JavaScript ES6 the operators that return a boolean value are the less-than, less-than-or-equal-to, greater-than, greater-than-or-equal-to, strict-equal, and loose-equal operators. A not operator will also provide you with a boolean value true when combined with any falsey object/value or false if combined with any truthy value.

  Researched answer:

    JavaScript has multiple categories of operators, but one category is comprised of operators that are designed to compare items and return boolean values, which are the Comparison Operators. The operators included in this category are the equal to ==, equal value and equal type ===, not equal !=, not equal value or not equal type !==, greater than >, less than <, greater than or equal to >=, and less than or equal to <=.
    The ternary operator while not evaluating to a boolean by itself, when used in it's entirety will provide a way to run code based on a truthy / falsey statement.
    The logical not operator or bang operator will provide the oposite boolean value for any data or reverse any boolean outcome of any complete statement. The logical not operator should be used sparingly.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:

    Index is used when referencing array like objects or strings, which indicates a key to the value of the item in the list based on an incrementing number, starting at zero for the first item/value and incrementing by one for each item in the array/string. The index is usually indicated by enclosing a number in square brackets to the right of the string or array. 
    The difference between index and value is that the index is the pointer indicating the address of the data stored and the value is the data to be used/displayed or modified.

  Researched answer:

    While working with objects in JavaScript, the way to access each bit of data you need to provide a key to get a value. JavaScript arrays are also considered objects, but they are comprised of a sequentially increasing index or number address starting from zero called an index instead of a named key to access the values.
    The difference between and index and value is that the index represents a key number/address used to select a piece of data also known as the value. A value is data that can include strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, or other non-typical data types.

4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:

    Iteration is the process of moving through multiple pieces of data systematically and executing the same steps for each item exactly like the last item, until all items have been processed/iterated over. This process is used in programming via loops and built in looping methods, such as: for loops, while loops, forEach method, .map method, and reduce method to name a few.

  Researched answer:

    Iteration in JavaScript is the process of looping through repetitive tasks using for, for/in, while, and do/while loops. Iteration ensures programmers stick to the DRY principle, which stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. Iteration allows for multiple pieces of data to passed into a function or loop that can complete the same computation, manipulation, or displaying of information.
    This process can be completed using declarative built in methods, such as the forEach, map, and reduce methods. These built in methods typically use less code to complete the same iterations, but come at a cost of performance.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

    Pair programming techniques are guidelines used to give structure to people who work on the same project to ensure code consistency, reduce code replecation, and project progression. Working with fellow developers at Learn Academy, we practice a driver/navigator pair programming technique. Driver/Navigator programming ensures programmers have a person working on the input of the code aka, the driver and the second pair programmer directing the drivers coding thinking about the larger picture, logic and research.
    The driver's primary of concern is the input of the code, ensuring the programming language syntax is correct. The driver can and is encouraged to comment or discuss any potential errors, possible code duplication, or more effective ways to complete a task that the navigator may suggest. 
    The navigator's responsibility is to think about the logic and process that will be required to complete the task at hand. This includes looking up concepts that may need to be learned to complete the task, breaking down the problem into individual tasks/processes.
    The driver and navigator combined are responsible for the entirety of the code submitted as well as switching positions to ensure experience is shared amongst partners. 

  Researched answer:

  In software development code is typically completed by teams of programmers, in agile software development pair programming was developed to have programmers work in pairs also known as Extreme programming. The term extreme programming has been more recently called pair programming and has expanded from two developers using the same keyboard and mouse to a more remote colaboration. Teams typically consist of a driver and a navigator, but can include multiple navigators in larger pair groups. 
  The driver is the programmer at the keyboard typing into the source code. The navigator is more focused on the research and directs the driver. The navigator ensures the code is free from errors and meets the company/teams code formatting. The pair are both responsible for the overall code but have twice the amount of eyes on any given project.
  Pair programming can ensure the projects code has less coding errors, since there are two sets of eyes looking at every line completed. Experience is increased or distributed more effectively since teams typically consist of two differently experienced developers.
